# Introduction

## Intentions

* Improve coding skills for yourself
* Write maintainable code for your future and successors
* Create high quality product for your team and client

## [Goals](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html#goals)

* **Improve maintainability and reduce [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt):** Code usually lives longer than the original author works on it and we are required to keep it working into the future. Even though technical debt isn't always bad, we want to write maintainable code in the long term.
<!--  -->
* **Improve readability by increasing consistency and preventing variation**: Most of developers' time are spent reading, rather than writing code. If codes written by different authors are similar, less effort and time are needed for themselves and their co-workers to adjust and digest.
<!--  -->
* **Establish code ownership**: Rules are meaningless if people do not follow. Leadership and discipline are required from both leaders and teammates to maintain a standard. After discussion, each member should have the right to change others' code if they don't have time to do it themselves.
<!-- TODO: Elaborate more on the fun and love part-->
* **Encourage communications with fun and love**: We suggested teams to maintain a weekly sprint meeting and code review as needed. 
<!--  -->
* **Follow the guidelines as much as possible**: This guideline is opinionated and conditional, meaning it does not apply to every developer and project. We also understand it is impossible to follow the rules perfectly. It goes without saying that we expect all the rules to be followed as much as possile.

## Tools

* `TSLint`
* `Prettier`
