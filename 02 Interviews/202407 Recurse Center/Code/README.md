## Tasks

### CracklePop

> Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any language.
<!--  -->
> Don’t submit a CracklePop without testing it to make sure it works. This shows carelessness and doesn’t give us confidence that you can program.

### TicTacToe

> Before your interview, write a program that lets two humans play a game of Tic Tac Toe in a terminal. The program should let the players take turns to input their moves. The program should report the outcome of the game.
<!--  -->
