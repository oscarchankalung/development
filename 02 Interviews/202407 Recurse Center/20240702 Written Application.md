### Code CracklePop

> Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any language.
<!--  -->
> Don’t submit a CracklePop without testing it to make sure it works. This shows carelessness and doesn’t give us confidence that you can program.

### Please link to a program you've written from scratch

> You can use something like GitHub's gist to host your code. It doesn't need to be long, but it should be something you've written yourself, and not using a framework (e.g., Rails). If you don't have anything to submit, code something small, like a game of tic-tac-toe.
<!--  -->
> Don’t paste the code of your program from scratch into the answer box on the application. Please link to it on GitHub or another website where it's hosted.

Hearthstone Card Random Generator. A few years ago when I first started learning web development.

At different jobs, I developed several mobile apps from scratch as a team, for example, a wine collection. These projects are cloned as private repos for personal reference while keeping confidentiality, but I'm happy to authorize access temporarily if anyone is interested.

### What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?

> This doesn't have to be about programming.
<!-- > -->
> Don’t answer the “fascinating thing” question with something you learned about yourself. This doesn’t demonstrate intellectual curiosity, which is what this question is there to measure.
<!--  -->
> Your best opportunity to demonstrate this in your application is the question about the most fascinating thing you’ve learned recently. We want to hear about something surprising you learned, and it doesn’t need to be about programming. We’ve seen great answers to this question about everything from making jewelry to plant taxonomy to music theory.

Well, I have a biology major, other than MBTI, how to unclog a toilet and mental health.

Genome imprinting. For both curosity and application. I dive deeper to research the answer. How do nature distinguish father and mother gene after growing up?

### What do you want to be doing in two years?

I don't have a clear plan. My current goals are to secure a job with reasonable compensation and try the programming industry in the US. Different work culture, and respect for technical personnel. Nerdy is a negative in Hong Kong. Non-social. Doing?

### Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?

Coderbunker. 42 Fremount, Community. And I didn't know how to fully utilize the support. Re-ignite the passion for programming. Other than programming skills, challenge my people skills and how to be a good and pleasant person in general.

### What would you like to work on at RC?

> E.g. things you want to learn or understand better, projects you want to build or contribute to, etc. Consider where the edge of your abilities is, and where you’d like it to be at the end of your batch.

Practically, refresh and enhance programming skills to land a good developer job, preferably a company with a good culture and ethics. Full stack development, either web or mobile.

## Background

### Describe your programming background in a few sentences

From Hong Kong to New York, self-taught, community, consultant through agency, 

### Have you worked professionally as a programmer?

> If so, please describe your experience.

Yes, other than my resume. Disappointing, no pair programming, not even code review! Coding Mockey. Developer to management roles, or senior developers, whose workload is too heavy, let alone mentor junior developers.

### Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?

No. Intensional choice. Not to downplay the value of a degree, but the ratio of the value is questionable. Otherwise Noble Table JavaScript bootcamp.

### What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?

> RC is a full-time commitment, and we ask that you plan to participate Monday-Friday during our core hours (11 am - 5 pm ET).

Part-time Cantonese interpreter at CyraCom, but I can easily quit. 6 hours per day, I assume some people stay longer than that, right?
