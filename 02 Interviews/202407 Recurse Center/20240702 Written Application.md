# 20240702 Written Application

[What we look for](https://www.recurse.com/what-we-look-for)

## Questions

### Links

> Please include any that you have: GitHub, LinkedIn, personal website, etc.

### Code CracklePop

> Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any language.
<!--  -->
> Don’t submit a CracklePop without testing it to make sure it works. This shows carelessness and doesn’t give us confidence that you can program.


```
```

### Please link to a program you've written from scratch

> You can use something like GitHub's gist to host your code. It doesn't need to be long, but it should be something you've written yourself, and not using a framework (e.g., Rails). If you don't have anything to submit, code something small, like a game of tic-tac-toe.
<!--  -->
> Don’t paste the code of your program from scratch into the answer box on the application. Please link to it on GitHub or another website where it's hosted.

### What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?

> This doesn't have to be about programming.
<!-- > -->
> Don’t answer the “fascinating thing” question with something you learned about yourself. This doesn’t demonstrate intellectual curiosity, which is what this question is there to measure.
<!--  -->
> Your best opportunity to demonstrate this in your application is the question about the most fascinating thing you’ve learned recently. We want to hear about something surprising you learned, and it doesn’t need to be about programming. We’ve seen great answers to this question about everything from making jewelry to plant taxonomy to music theory.
