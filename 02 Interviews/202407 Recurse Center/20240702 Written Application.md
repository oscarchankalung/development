### Code CracklePop

> Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any language.
<!--  -->
> Don’t submit a CracklePop without testing it to make sure it works. This shows carelessness and doesn’t give us confidence that you can program.

### Please link to a program you've written from scratch

> You can use something like GitHub's gist to host your code. It doesn't need to be long, but it should be something you've written yourself, and not using a framework (e.g., Rails). If you don't have anything to submit, code something small, like a game of tic-tac-toe.
<!--  -->
> Don’t paste the code of your program from scratch into the answer box on the application. Please link to it on GitHub or another website where it's hosted.

### What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?

> This doesn't have to be about programming.
<!-- > -->
> Don’t answer the “fascinating thing” question with something you learned about yourself. This doesn’t demonstrate intellectual curiosity, which is what this question is there to measure.
<!--  -->
> Your best opportunity to demonstrate this in your application is the question about the most fascinating thing you’ve learned recently. We want to hear about something surprising you learned, and it doesn’t need to be about programming. We’ve seen great answers to this question about everything from making jewelry to plant taxonomy to music theory.

Other than sex chromosomes, it may seem common sense to assume genetic contributions from father and mother are equivalent, but nature always has an exception. Genomic imprinting is a natural phenomenon that suggests a sexual tug-of-war has been ongoing at the molecular level of the human species.

The core phase happens after fertilization when maternal and paternal genomes compete to imprint the DNA to regulate gene expression epigenetically. For example, DNA methylation turns the gene on, and DNA demethylation turns the gene off.

It turned out that many imprinted genes are involved in growth and metabolism. Maternal imprinting reduces the growth of offspring by favoring uniform distribution of resources. In contrast, paternal imprinting promotes the growth of offspring by increasing the acquisition of nutrients from the mother. This constitutes the basis of Parental Conflict Theory, which proposes imprinting grew out of a competition between males for maternal resources.

This concept is consistent with classical natural selection and sperm competition. In some species, a female can mate more than once and have offspring from two or more males. If one father’s offspring grows larger than the rest, his offspring will be more likely to survive adulthood and pass along their genes.

More interestingly, this biased gene expression is only observed in mammals and seed plants, in which the development of fetuses and seeds depends solely on resources provided by the mother. However, such bias doesn’t occur in fish and birds, in which the number of resources deposited in the egg is determined by the mother before fertilization. This is also true for egg-laying mammals, but not for pouched mammals.

The story does not end here. Since not all imprinted genes regulate growth, parental conflict theory does not apply to those cases. Many non-conflict theories have therefore been proposed. These alternative hypotheses may revise the entrenched view of kinship or sexual conflict in humans and other organisms.

### What do you want to be doing in two years?

As a Cantonese interpreter earning minimum wages, my short-term career goal is to secure a developer job with reasonable compensation. Although I don't think this will be the case, my plan B is to spend the money and apply for Noble Desktop's JavaScript Development Certificate.

I want to improve my financial situation and I owe myself a chance to try working in the US tech industry. Unlike the US where being nerdy and working in tech is usually celebrated and respected, HK has a stereotypical negative annotation towards tech guys. During an interview, one of my supervisors referred to entry-level programmers like me as "coding monkeys", even though he was one of us.

### Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?

Since I have been dealing with immigration and mental health issues, I haven't been coding for more than a year. Again, being a developer in HK disappointed and consumed me. To name another example, because of the culture and budget, we rarely, if not never, do pair programming, code reviews, or automated tests. By joining RC, I can refresh my skills and see how things are different on the other end of the globe.

I tasted and understood the benefits of programming communities because I had joined them, like Coderbunker in Shanghai and 42 Silicon Valley in Fremont. I must admit I couldn't and didn't know how to fully utilize the support, which always takes more than technical skills and tests what kind of person you are. Now that I'm more mature, I look forward to how much more I can gain and achieve this time.

### What would you like to work on at RC?

> E.g. things you want to learn or understand better, projects you want to build or contribute to, etc. Consider where the edge of your abilities is, and where you’d like it to be at the end of your batch.

Please refer to my LinkedIn and CV for my career and programming background. I mainly worked on front-end and mobile apps using React Native. Let me know if you have any suggestions on my goal.

My top priority is practical - learn the required skills to land a developer job, most likely full-stack, either mobile or web, preferably in a company or team with a good culture and ethics.

Otherwise, I'm open to anything from data engineering to decentralized technologies. Since I majored in biology, projects that combine both fields would be intriguing. I briefly considered getting a master's in bioinformatics after graduation. Biohacking is fascinating yet extreme, I prefer not to micro-manage my body.

## Background

> This information will not disqualify your application. We use it to better get to know our applicants and where they currently are.

### Describe your programming background in a few sentences

Again, my LinkedIn and CV have all the facts and data, so I’m describing it differently here.

From Shanghai, Fremount, and Hong Kong to New York, I'm a self-taught developer inspired by programming communities. Ask me how I ended up in Shanghai after graduating from a university in Hong Kong.

Starting with online courses like Datacamp (data science with Python) and freeCodeCamp (web development with JavaScript) in a Shanghai coworking space, I passed the 1-month Piscine of 42 (vanilla coding with C) with a tourist visa, then returned to Hong Kong to join a consultant agency that trains fresh graduate for 3 months (business application with Java) and exploits them for at least 2 years.

Since then, I worked in an investment bank as a pseudo-developer, a local project-based start-up with less than 10 people, and an extensive Chinese-funded company that leeches on government projects.

### Have you worked professionally as a programmer?

> If so, please describe your experience.

Yes. Simply put, programming at home, work, or in a community is different. Although I was frustrated with how things were professionally, to quote from NBA players, it's all business. I’m not only blaming the industry. A large part is personal too.

In theory, if one is smart, works hard, and has the time, one can learn and do almost any technical thing. Other than time is always insufficient, it is more of a mental, rather than intellectual, challenge to be a programmer professionally. Especially for self-taught like me, the journal is fueled with anxiety, imposter syndrome, financial concerns, and burnout.

Consistently facing things one hasn’t done before isn’t always fun. With regular jobs or my current role as an interpreter over the phone, one usually learns all the skills required in 3 months. It’s easy for me to be obsessive or hooked doing this job. This trait serves me well in the short term but isn’t sustainable or healthy. I’m still figuring out how to achieve mindfulness around it.

### Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?

No. Not to downplay the value of a degree, but the cost-benefit ratio is questionable.

Apart from being a secure career choice, I was drawn to this field by the supportive online communities where one can learn almost anything at little to no cost. Sharing knowledge for free is one of the most selfless acts. I owe my current life to all the online contributors in GitHub, StackOverflow, and numerous other websites.

Plus, university courses are usually detached from the business world to my knowledge. Learning the theory and practicing in a peer environment is invaluable, but there are too many better alternatives, arguably.

### What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?

> RC is a full-time commitment, and we ask that you plan to participate Monday-Friday during our core hours (11 am - 5 pm ET).

Not really. I can easily quit my current job as a part-time Cantonese interpreter at CyraCom. Since I’m separated from my wife who sponsored my visa and promised to keep doing it for my green card application, I’m single in this magical foreign city with no blood relatives.

I assume the schedule is 5 hours s work plus 1 hour of lunch per day? I assume some people stay longer than that, right?
