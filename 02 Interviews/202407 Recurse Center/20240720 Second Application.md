I was hijacked by anxiety.

## What do you want to be doing in two years?

Metaphysically and ultimately, I want to regain my autonomy so that I can do whatever I want to do. With that, I want to build a mindful and meaningful life. That involves keeping composure despite stressful situations, creating a sincere support system, and working in whatever field or place I enjoy while earning reasonable compensation. Living, programming or other activities is a means to an end. It's a fun game or art that provides a playground to actualize oneself.

Although joining a boot camp wouldn't hurt, I have what it takes to make myself a full-stack developer without it. If I'm afraid a full-time job would be too much for me, I can start with part-time or freelance. Now that I figured out how to survive with a monthly income of $1500, anything more than that will be a bonus.
