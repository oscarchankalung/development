# 20240720 Second Application

Whatever, I still very much want to join RC, but I found Saba Mahmood.

## What do you want to be doing in two years?

**1st attempt**

As a Cantonese interpreter earning minimum wages, my short-term career goal is to secure a developer job with reasonable compensation. Although I don't think this will be the case, my plan B is to spend the money and apply for Noble Desktop's JavaScript Development Certificate.

I want to improve my financial situation and I owe myself a chance to try working in the US tech industry. Unlike the US where being nerdy and working in tech is usually celebrated and respected, HK has a stereotypical negative annotation towards tech guys. During an interview, one of my supervisors referred to entry-level programmers like me as "coding monkeys", even though he was one of us.

**2nd attempt**

Metaphysically and ultimately, I want to regain my autonomy so that I can do whatever I want to do. With that, I want to build a mindful and meaningful life. That involves keeping composure despite stressful situations, creating a sincere support system, and working in whatever field or place I enjoy while earning reasonable compensation. Living, programming or other activities is a means to an end. It's a fun game or art that provides a playground to actualize oneself.

Although joining a boot camp wouldn't hurt, I have what it takes to make myself a full-stack developer without it. If I'm afraid a full-time job would be too much for me, I can start with part-time or freelance. Now that I figured out how to survive with a monthly income of $1500, anything more than that will be a bonus.

**3rd attempt**

Metaphysically, I try to prioritize being present and living in the moment over achieving success. My current job as a minimum-wage Cantonese interpreter is facile and charitable, but underwhelming. By joining RC, I hope I can get back to the better-paid and more challenging tech industry without ruining my mental health.

This ultra-capitalistic system slaves people with workaholism.

I need to earn money so that I can attend university classes in English, Psychology, Anthropology, Gender Studies, Art...

**4th attempt**

Iâ€™m fucking anxious. I kept rethinking this question, such that I withdrew and un-withdrew the application. I interpret the question as what I want to do for the rest of my life. I concluded to myself: For now, I just want to stay in the US, earn more money by doing tech, and do whatever I want to do with more resources.

## Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?

**1st attempt**

Since I have been dealing with immigration and mental health issues, I haven't been coding for more than a year. Again, being a developer in HK disappointed and consumed me. To name another example, because of the culture and budget, we rarely, if not never, do pair programming, code reviews, or automated tests. By joining RC, I can refresh my skills and see how things are different on the other end of the globe.

I tasted and understood the benefits of programming communities because I had joined them, like Coderbunker in Shanghai and 42 Silicon Valley in Fremont. I must admit I couldn't and didn't know how to fully utilize the support, which always takes more than technical skills and tests what kind of person you are. Now that I'm more mature, I look forward to how much more I can gain and achieve this time.

**2nd attempt**

I want to become self-directive. Whether it's family, school, or work, the Asian culture I grew up in drives me psychotic and prevents me from actualizing my potential significantly. If I'm in a community with kind people, positive feedback and suitable support, I believe only the sky is the limit. This is dramatic. And I admit I don't dare to say it out, but at least I can write it down.

Realistically, I haven't been coding for more than a year as I've been dealing with issues like mental health, immigration, and separation from my spouse. I'm single in this magical foreign city with no blood relative. I yearn for a more meaningful job, a better income, and connections. The times in programming communities like Coderbunker in Shanghai and 42 School in Fremont California were some of the happier periods in my life. I understand RC is the place where I can get all of that.

## What would you like to work on at RC?

**1st attempt**

My top priority is practical - learn the required skills to land a developer job, most likely full-stack, either mobile or web, preferably in a company or team with a good culture and ethics.

Otherwise, I'm open to anything from data engineering to decentralized technologies. Since I majored in biology, projects that combine both fields would be intriguing. I briefly considered getting a master's in bioinformatics after graduation. Biohacking is fascinating yet extreme, I prefer not to micro-manage my body.

**2nd attempt**

* Volunteer for pair programming
* Acquire the skills to be full-stack
* Learn from others and share what I learn.
* Get to know everyone's name and background, if not their story
* Write codes and diaries every day if possible
* Being present and mindful while programming.
