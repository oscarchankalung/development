## Transformative Shifts in Barriers

* Overcoming intolerance of diversity and building respect for the values and aspirations of others (as with increasing the rights of migrants or reducing social norms that discriminate against women)
* Broadening political representation and public dialogue (as with quotas for political participation of under-represented groups)
* Increasing the bargaining power of marginalized and excluded groups (as with upholding rights of freedom of association and making public investments in quality education)
* Shifting from a national or community based identity to self-identification as part of a global community (as with campaigns on the importance of global public goods)
